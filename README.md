# ooyes
click ooyes to send $0.01 in appreciation to the creator

App puts an ooyes button into the browser (eventually facebook, g+, twiter, instagram, etc).  Like the page a lot then click ooyes button to send one cent to the page creator (invitation to join ooyes).  Join then decide if you want to contribute, if so put $10 a month into your ooyes account, gives you 1,000 ooyeses.  Any of the $10 not contributed goes to pay the ooyes people for the app.  Contibutors can only ooyes a page or whatever once.  Nobody can put more than $10 a month into their ooyes account.  No ads. 

Ideally the ooyes button will be embedded in the browser so contributors can just click. 

Anyone out there fancy making ooyes real?
